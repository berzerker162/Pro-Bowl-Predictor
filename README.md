# Pro-Bowl-Predictor
This project aims to predict the likelihood that an NFL player reaches the Pro Bowl based on their Combine performance

This is a work in progress. 

scraper.py: As of 1/27/2021 scraper.py is up to date and will allow a user to run the code and fetch all the NFL combine data from the web

nfl_combine.py: As of 1/27/2021 nfl_combine.py flags all probowlers and visualizes the 40-yard dash distributions of non-pro bowl cornerbacks versus pro bowl cornerbackers. There remains much work to do.
