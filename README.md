This project aims to predict the likelihood that an NFL player reaches the Pro Bowl based on their Combine performance

This is a work in progress. 

pro_bowl_scraper.py: As of 1/27/2021pro_bowl_scraper.py is up to date and will allow a user to run the code and fetch all the NFL pro bowlers from the past 20 years

nfl_combine.py: As of 1/27/2021 nfl_combine.py flags all probowlers and visualizes the 40-yard dash distributions of non-pro bowl cornerbacks versus pro bowl cornerbackers. There remains much work to do.
